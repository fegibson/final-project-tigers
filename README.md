# This is the README file for final-project-tigers

This repository is for hosting and documenting progress related to my final project for the DataTrail course. This project will focus primarily on human-tiger conflicts in India.

The folders in this project are:

* _data_ - is the folder where I will put all the data I have collected.
* _results_ - is where I will put the results (tables, graphs, etc.) of my analysis.

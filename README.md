# This is the README file for final-project-tigers

This repository is for hosting and documenting progress related to my final project for the DataTrail course. This project will focus primarily on human-tiger conflicts in India.

The folders in this project are:

* _data_ - is the folder where I will put all the data I have collected.
    + _raw_data_ - original versions of data used will be stored here
    + _tidy_data_ - cleaned versions of data used will be stored here
* _results_ - is where I will put the results (tables, graphs, etc.) of my analysis.
